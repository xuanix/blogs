If you want to list all dogs with a name that starts with "h", you should write:
<pre><code>select name from dogs where 'h' <= name and name < 'i';</code></pre>

<h3>Question 1</h3>
<pre><code>create table size_of_dogs as
select name, size from dogs, sizes where min < height and height <= max;
</code></pre>

<h3>Question 2</h3>
<pre><code>create table by_height as
select child from parents, dogs where parent = name order by -height;
</code></pre>

<h3>Question 3</h3>
<pre><code>create table sentences as
  with
    siblings(first, second) as (
      select a.child, b.child from parents as a, parents as b 
        where a.parent = b.parent and a.child > b.child 
    )
  select first || ' and ' || second || ' are ' || a.size || ' siblings' 
    from siblings, size_of_dogs as a, size_of_dogs as b 
    where a.size = b.size and a.name = first and b.name = second;
</code></pre>

<h3>Question 4</h3>
<pre><code>create table stacks as
  with 
    stack_recur(dogs, total, n, max) as (
      select name, height, 1, height from dogs union
      select dogs || ', ' || name, total+height, n+1, height 
        from stack_recur, dogs
        where n < 4 and max < height
    )
select dogs, total from stack_recur 
  where total >= 170 and n = 4 order by total;</code></pre>

<h3>Question 5</h3>
<pre><code>select max(height), name from dogs group by height/10 having count(name) > 1;
</code></pre>

<h3>Question 6</h3>
<pre><code>select a.child as first, b.parent as second from parents as a, parents as b 
  where a.parent = b.child union
  select a.child, c.parent from parents as a, parents as b, parents as c 
    where a.parent = b.child and b.parent = c.child;</code></pre>
