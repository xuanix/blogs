<h2>A. Java Compilation & Development</h2>

<h3>Why Compilation?</h3>
Compilers are quite helpful for reasons:

* Compilers can check for errors such as *type errors* and *syntax errors*. 

* Compilers can help speed up programs since translate high level language into lower or machine language and saves the instruction in a file called *binary*.

* Compilers can verify access rights to classes and methods.

* Others introudced in CS61C.

<h3>Compiling Java Programs</h3>

We will be using <code>javac</code> as compiler which is included in Oracle's Java Development Kit(JDK).

<pre><code>$ javac (-g) File.java</code></pre>
Where flag "-g" is helpful for generatting debugging information

<h3>Running Java programs</h3>
Compiling your program give you <code>.class</code> files which contain bytecode.

<pre><code>$ java File</code></pre>

<h2>B. Writing Java Programs</h2>

<h3>Java is Object-Oriented</h3>

<pre><code>import java.io.*;

class LeapYear {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
		BufferedReader keybd = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		int year = Integer.parseInt(keybd.readLine());
		if (year % 400 == 0) {
			System.out.println(year + " is a leap year.");
		} else if (year % 100 != 0 && year % 4 == 0) {
			System.out.println(year + " is a leap year.");
		} else {
			System.out.println(year + " is not a leap year.");
		}
	}
}</code></pre>
