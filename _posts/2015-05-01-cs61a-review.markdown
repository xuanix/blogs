## Reading 1.1, Reading 1.2 and Lecture

* An **Expression** describes a computation and evaluates to a value. All expression can use *function call notation*, known as **Call Expression**. *Anatomy* of a call expression are **Operator** and **operand**. 

* Python defines a very large number of functions, but some of them are not available by default. Instead, one need to **Import Library Functions**. 

* In python, computational objects can be refered by <strong>names</strong>, that can be maintained and tracked in some of memory known as <strong>Environment</strong>.

* We use <strong>Expression Tree</strong> to understand and evaluate nested expressions.

* <strong>Pure functions</strong> have input and return output, whereas <strong>Non-Pure Functions</strong> have additional <strong>side effects</strong> such as <code>print</code> function which return <code>None</code> but its side effect displays the printed value.

## lab 00

* Introduction
  * Comments in UNIX usually has three parts: **comment** itself, **arguments** in order to make comments to work, **flags** which are ways to specify modified behavior for commands.
	<pre><code>rm -r tmp</code></pre>
  * Here is an example commend in UNIX. <code>rm</code> is comment itself, <code>-r</code> is flag to recursively remove a specified directory, and <code>temp</code> is argument, in this case, it's the specified directory.

* Directories:
  * <code>ls</code>: <strong>list</strong> files and directories (folders).
  * <code>mkdir</code>: <strong>make</strong> a new <strong>directory</strong>.
  * <code>cd</code>: <strong>change directory</strong>.
  * <code>rm -r</code>: <strong>remove</strong> a specified directory <strong>recursively</strong>.

* Files:
  * <code>cat</code>: displays the contents of a file on the screen.
  * <code>mv</code>: <strong>moves</strong> a file/directory to another file/directory. Can be used for <strong>rename</strong>. <code>..</code> <strong>parent</strong> directory. <code>.</code> <strong>current</strong> directory.
  * <code>cp</code>: <strong>copies</strong> a file to another file/directory.
  * <code>rm</code>: <strong>removes</strong> a file.

* Miscellaneous:
  * <code>echo</code>echo: <strong>echo</strong>(repeat) the words typed.
  * <code>man some_command</code>: displays <strong>manual</strong> pages for a specified command

## Lab 01

* **Running doctests**
  *	<pre><code>python3 -m doctest lab01.py</code></pre>
  * Running the code above to **debug** the function.
  * <pre><code>def my_email():
    """Return your last name as a string.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; my_email() != 'oski@berkeley.edu'
    True
    """
    return 'jane.doe@berkeley.edu'</code></pre>
  * Content quoted by <code>"""</code> is **docstring**. Within the *docstring*, lines begin with <code>>>></code> are **doctests**.
  * Be default, doctests only output **failures**. If one prefer to see all, call "verbose"
  * <pre><code>python3 -m doctest -v lab01.py</code></pre>

## Reading 1.3 and 1.4

* The *scope* of **Local Names** only survives in its local frame. 
* Functions usually have three core attributes: *domain* (formal parameters), *range* (return), and *intent* (relationship between the two).
* When designing functions, **docstring** introduces the function, which must be quoted by <code>"""</code>. One can call <code>help(function)</code> to see its docstring (type <code>q</code> to quit help). <code>#</code> to comment.
* Set up **Default Argument Values** for convinent. 

## Lecture

* **Names** is one of *primitive expressions (number, name, string)* that can be *bound* to refer a value or an *object (function)*.
* *Names* are stored in *environment* also called **Frame**. Calling a function creates a specific **Local Frame**. The root frame is **Global Frame**. If a name cannot be found in local frame, then try to find it in global frame such as <code>max</code>. *Name* between local frame and global frame can be **repeated**.
* **Assignment** statements evaluate expressions starts at *right* of = from left to right. *Bind* all names to the *left* of = to those resulting values *in the current frame*. 
* *Assignment* is one simple means of **abstraction**: binds names to values, while **Function defination** is a more powerfull abstraction: binds names to expressions. Every function can be considered as an *object*. To define a function has the form 

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; def &lt;name&gt;(&lt;formal parameters&gt;): 
          return &lt;return expression&gt;</pre>

* **Function Signature** is the first line content after <code>def</code>; The rest is **Function body**. The following lines must **indented**.
* *Adding a local frame* is the first step of *calling user-defined functions*. 
* Name evaluation firstly looks in *local frame*. If not found, try *global frame* such as <code>max</code>. To clearly understand, draw **environment diagrams**.
* **Pure Functions** have *input* and return *output*, whereas *Non-Pure Functions* have additional **side effect** to change the state of interpreter or computer. For example, <code>print</code> returns <code>None</code> and displays contents by side effect.

## Reading 1.5

* **Control statement** consists of **expression** (**headers**), and **suites**.
* **Boolean contexts**. <code>0, None, False</code> are false values.
* Functions return a *boolean values* typically begin with <code>is</code>, not followed by an *underscore*. (e.g. isfinite).
* Use <code>assert</code> statement to **Testing**, and contexts are quoted by <code>'</code>. Test files are write in a neighboring file with suffix &nbsp; *_text.py*.

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; def fib_test():
        assert fib(2) == 1, 'The 2nd Fibonacci number should be 1'
        assert fib(3) == 1, 'The 3rd Fibonacci number should be 1'
        assert fib(50) == 7778742049, 'Error at the 50th Fibonacci number'
</pre>
* **Doctests**. *Simple test directly* in the *docstring* of a function. First line is *description* of function, followed by a **blank line**. such as

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; def sum_naturals(n):
    """Return the sum of the first n natural numbers.

    >>> sum_naturals(10)
    55
    >>> sum_naturals(100)
    5050
    """
    total, k = 0, 1
    while k <= n:
        total, k = total + k, k + 1
    return total
</pre>

* All *global functions* can test by **doctest module**

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; from doctest import testmod
&gt;&gt;&gt; testmod()
TestResults(failed=0, attempted=2)

</pre>
* If want to test one function, use

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; from doctest import run_docstring_examples
&gt;&gt;&gt; run_docstring_examples(sum_naturals, globals(), True)
</pre>
* All doctests *in one file* can be run by starting Python with doctest

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; python3 -m doctest &lt;python_source_file&gt;</pre>

## Lecture

* In **Multiple Environments**, the *last* generated frame is considered as *earliest frame* of the current environment
* Test function by **doctest** within **docstring**.
* **Conditional statement**, <code>if, elif, else</code>
* **Iteration statement**, <code>while</code>

<strong class="date">05/07/2015.</strong> 

* A **guide** to designing function: each function has one job, don't repeat yourself, and **generally** define function.
* Function can be used as **arguments**, **return**, **locally defined**. 

## Extra Lecture 1
* **Lambda Expressions**
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; square = lambda x: x * x
</pre>
Read it in English: Define a function with formal parameter x that returns the value of "x * x".

* **Newton's Method**

Newton's method quickly finds accurate approximations to *zeros* of differentiable function. In another word, finds $x_0$ in $f(x)$ such that $f(x_0)=0$, where $x_0$ is known as **zero** of $f(x)$. 

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/newton.png">

Given a function $f$ and initial *guess* x, improve current $x$ by using slop (derivative) $f^\prime (x)$. Based on the current length $-f(x)$ from $0$, the $x$ need to change $\frac{f(x)}{f^\prime (x)}$ according to $tan(\alpha)$. So x can be updated by 

$$x = x-\frac{f(x)}{f^\prime (x)}$$
#### Let's implement newton's method
