<p><em>Imperative programming</em> is a programming style where code is written as a set of instructins for the computer. In this section, we introduce <em>declarative programming</em> - code that declares <em>what</em> we want, not <em>how</em> to compute it.</p>

<h3>1.1 The SQL Language</h3>

<pre><code>select * from records where name = supervisor;</code></pre>
<li></li>
<pre><code>select name from records where salary &gt; 50000 order by name;</code></pre>
</ol>

<h3>2.2 Joins</h3>
<h3>2.3 Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li></li>
<pre><code>select e.name, e.salary, s.name, s.salary 
    from records as e, records as s
    where e.supervisor = s.name and s.salary &gt; 2 * e.salary;
</code></pre>
<li></li>
<pre><code>select e.name from records as e, records as s
    where e.supervisor = s.name and e.division &lt;&gt; s.division;
</code></pre>
<li></li>
<pre><code>
select day, time from records as r, meeting as m
    where r.division = m.division and r.suppervisor = 'Oliver Warbucks';
</code></pre>
</ol>

<h3>2.4 Extra Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li></li>
<pre><code>select b.name from records as a, records as b 
    where a.supervisor = b.name and b.supervisor &lt;&gt; b.name
</code></pre>
<li></li>
<pre><code>Alyssa P Hacker
Ben Bitdiddle
Ben Bitdiddle
Ben Bitdiddle</code></pre>
There are multiple people with Ben Bitdiddle as supervisor, and joining tables together does not remove these duplicates.
<li></li>
<pre><code>select from records as e, records as s, meeting as em, meeting as sm
    where e.supervisor = s.name and e.division = em.division and s.division = sm.division and em.day = sm.day
</code></pre>
</ol>

<h2>Local Tables</h2>
<p>Syntax</p>
<pre><code>with
    table(columns) as (
    select [cols] from [nms] where [cond] order by [order]
    )
</code></pre>

<h3>3.1 Recursion</h3>
<pre><code>create table natural as
    with num(n) as (

        select n + 1from num
            where n &lt; 3
    )
    select * from num;
</code></pre>

<h3>3.2 Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li></li>
