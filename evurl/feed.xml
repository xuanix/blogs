        <title>Basic Concept of Convex Optimization</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Convext optimization have been widely used in data science area. This blog will cover some basic knowledge about it, such as Lagrange dual and KKT conditions. I will not state the function is whether convex or not, becasue that will confuse people if they don’t have those background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lagrange-dual-problem&quot;&gt;Lagrange Dual Problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The standard form of any optimization problem is 
\begin{equation} 
max\{f(x):c(x)\geq 0_{m\times 1}\},\label{opt}
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where $f(x):\mathbb{R}^n\mapsto \mathbb{R}$ and $c(x):\mathbb{R}^n\mapsto \mathbb{R}^m$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To easily and clearly derive the lagrange dual problme, I take &lt;strong&gt;linear optimization problem&lt;/strong&gt; as an example. Every linear optimization problem can formulated as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{align} 
&amp;amp;\underset{x}{\text{max}}&amp;amp; &amp;amp; c^Tx \newline 
&amp;amp; \text{subject to}
&amp;amp; &amp;amp; Ax \leq b 
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where $\,x\in \mathbb{R}^n, c\in \mathbb{R}^n, b\in \mathbb{R}^m, A\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$. This is the primal problem. If this problem is hard to solve, we could solve its lagrange dual problem instead. Let’s derivative its lagrange dual problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We drop the constrain $Ax\leq b$ by introducing a multiplier $y \in \mathbb{R}_+^m$ and adding the result to the objective function in terms of penalty. The new objective function is knwon as &lt;strong&gt;Lagrange function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{equation}
	L_p(x, y) = c^Tx + y^T(b-Ax)
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because $y \geq 0$ and $b-Ax\geq 0$, we know that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{equation}
	L_p(x,y) \geq c^Tx \label{lagrange equation}
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assume $y$ is given, we want to maximize Lagrange function with respective to $x$. Hence, the minimum of this objective function is a function of $y$, which is known as &lt;strong&gt;dual function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{align} 
	g(y)&amp;amp;= \underset{x}{\text{max}} \, L_p(x, y)\newline
	 &amp;amp;= \underset{x}{\text{max}} \,c^Tx + y^T(b-Ax)\newline
	 &amp;amp;= \underset{x}{\text{max}} \,(c^T-y^TA)x + y^Tb=
	 \begin{cases}
	y^Tb  &amp;amp; \text{ if } x\ge y^TA=c^T \newline
	+\infty &amp;amp; \text{ otherwise } 
	\end{cases}
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on \eqref{lagrange equation}, for any feasible solutions $x$ and $y$, $g(y)$ is greater than or equal to the maximum of primal objective function $c^Tx$. So the minimum of $g(y)$ is equal to the maximum of $c^Tx$. We formulate the &lt;strong&gt;lagrange dual problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{align} 
&amp;amp;\underset{y}{\text{min}}&amp;amp; &amp;amp; g(y)=b^Ty \newline 
&amp;amp; \text{subject to}
&amp;amp; &amp;amp; A^Ty = c\newline
&amp;amp; &amp;amp; &amp;amp; y \geq 0 
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;kkt-condition&quot;&gt;KKT condition&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KKT condition stands for &lt;strong&gt;Karush-Kuhn-Tucher&lt;/strong&gt; condition. The KKT condition is that for any optimization problem \eqref{opt}, if $x^*$ is local minimum that satisifes some &lt;em&gt;regularity conditions&lt;/em&gt; (see below), there exists a vector $\,\lambda\in \mathbb{R}^m$ such that
\begin{align} 
&amp;amp;\nabla f(x)+\lambda^T \nabla c(x)=0_{n\times 1} \newline 
&amp;amp; c(x) \geq 0_{m\times 1}\newline
&amp;amp; \lambda \geq 0_{m\times 1}\newline
&amp;amp; \lambda^Tc(x) = 0_{m\times 1} 
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to for a minum point $x^{*}$ to satisfy the above KKT conditions, the problem should satisfy some &lt;strong&gt;regularity conditions&lt;/strong&gt;. Since we use linear programming as an example, we only list &lt;strong&gt;linearity constrain qualification&lt;/strong&gt;, that is, $c(x)$ is a set of affine functions. Affine function has formulation $\beta^Tx+\beta_0$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In linear programming above (2)-(3), KKT condition includes (3),(10),(11), and 
\begin{equation}
	y^T(b-A^Tx)=0
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that KKT conditions are both sufficient and necessary for optimlity. On anthoer word, &lt;em&gt;for any given optimal solution $x_0$ to linear programming if and only if there exists \lambda_0 that satisfies the KKT conditions&lt;/em&gt;. On the otherhand, &lt;em&gt;For general nonlinear programming, KKT conditions are neither sufficient nor necessary for optimality&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to lagrange dual problems, we can prove &lt;strong&gt;weak duality&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;strong duality&lt;/strong&gt; by using KKT conditons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;theorm-of-weak-duality&quot;&gt;Theorm of weak duality&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; are feasible solutions to $max\{c^Tx:Ax\leq b\}$ and $min\{b^Ty:A^Ty\geq c, y\geq 0\}$, respectively, then $c^Tx \leq b^Ty$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;proof&quot;&gt;Proof&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Since &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; are feasible, we have
\begin{equation}
	0\leq (b-Ax)^Ty=b^Ty-(Ax)^Ty=b^Ty-y^T Ax,
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
	0\leq (A^Ty-c)^Tx=y^TAx-c^Tx.
\end{equation}
Therefore, $c^Tx\leq y^TAx \leq b^Ty$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;theorm-of-strong-duality&quot;&gt;Theorm of Strong duality&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; are optimal solutions to $max\{c^Tx:Ax\leq b\}$ and $min\{b^Ty:A^Ty\geq c, y\geq 0\}$, respectively, then $c^Tx = b^Ty$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;proof-1&quot;&gt;Proof&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Since &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; are optimal, by last KKT condition (15), we have
\begin{equation}
	0= (b-Ax)^Ty=b^Ty-(Ax)^Ty=b^Ty-y^TAx,
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
	0= (A^Ty-c)^Tx=y^TAx-c^Tx.
\end{equation}
Therefore, $c^Tx= y^TAx= b^Ty$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Suport vector machine #2 - Maximal margin classifier</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this blog, I am gonna cover the derivation of &lt;strong&gt;maximal marigin classifier&lt;/strong&gt;. In order to understand the process, you need to know &lt;em&gt;KKT condition&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Lagrange dual&lt;/em&gt;. If you are not so familier with those knowledge, please check another &lt;a href=&quot;http://gaotx.com/blogs/2015/04/14/kkt-cvx/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blogs/img/maximal-margin/maximal-margin-classifier.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gaotx.com/blogs/2015/04/12/maximal-margin-classifier/&quot;&gt;previous blog&lt;/a&gt;, we derived the formulation of $M$, which is half of margin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{equation}
	M =\cfrac{y(\beta^Tx+\beta_0)}{||\beta||}
	\label{hypeplane}
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to find maximal margin hyperplane that has the farthest distances from observations. This separating hyperplane is just the solution to the optimization problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{align} 
&amp;amp;\underset{\beta,\beta_0, ||\beta||=1}{\text{max}}&amp;amp; &amp;amp; M\\ 
&amp;amp; \text{subject to}
&amp;amp; &amp;amp; y_i(\beta^Tx_i+\beta_0) \geq M, \; i = 1, \ldots, n.
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The set of constraints ensure that every observations are at least a signed distance $M$ from the hyperplane which is defined as $\beta^Tx+\beta_0=0$. Note that 
$
	||\beta||=1
$
is not realy constraint, since if $\beta^Tx+\beta_0=0$ defines a separating hyperplane, so does $k(\beta^Tx+\beta_0)=0$ for any $k\neq0$. However, it adds meaning to constraint (3), because of $\beta$ has been normalized, constraint (3) is the perpendicular distance from the &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;th observation to the hyperplane. On the other hand we can get rid of it by replacing the constrain (3) with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\cfrac{1}{||\beta||}y_i(\beta^Tx_i+\beta_0) \geq M&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(which redefines $\beta_0$) or equivalently&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;y_i(\beta^Tx_i+\beta_0) \geq M||\beta||&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Since for any $\beta_0$ and $\beta$ satisfying these inequaties, any positively scaled multiple satisfies them too, just like define a separating hyperplane, we can arbitrarily set $&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;\beta&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;= 1/M$. Thus (2)-(3) is equivalent to&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{align} 
&amp;amp;\underset{\beta,\beta_0}{\text{max}}&amp;amp; &amp;amp; \cfrac{1}{||\beta||}\\ 
&amp;amp; \text{subject to}
&amp;amp; &amp;amp; y_i(\beta^Tx_i+\beta_0) \geq 1, \; i = 1, \ldots, n.
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maximizing $1/||\beta||$ is equivalent to minimizing $||\beta||$, and further minimizing
 $
 \cfrac{1}{2}||\beta||^2= \cfrac{1}{2}\beta^T\beta
 $
 for mathmatic convinence. Thus, (4)-(5) is equivalent to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{align} 
&amp;amp;\underset{\beta,\beta_0}{\text{min}}&amp;amp; &amp;amp; \cfrac{1}{2}\beta^T\beta \newline 
\label{primal:contraint}
&amp;amp; \text{subject to}
&amp;amp; &amp;amp; y_i(\beta^Tx_i+\beta_0) \geq 1, \; i = 1, \ldots, n.
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a convex optimization problem (quadratic criterion with linear inequality constraints). The Lagrange (primal) function is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{equation}
  L(\beta,\beta_0,\alpha)=\cfrac{1}{2}\beta^T\beta-\sum_{i=1}^{n}\alpha_i[y_i(\beta^Tx_i+\beta_0)-1]
  \label{primal}
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and the corresponding dual function is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{equation}
	g(\alpha) = \underset{\alpha}{\text{min}}\;L(\beta,\beta_0,\alpha)
	\label{dual:function1}
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to calculate the minimum of $L(\beta,\beta_0,\alpha)$, as it is quadratic function, we can set the partial derivatives for $\beta$ and $\beta_0$ to zero, we obtain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{equation}
	\beta = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\alpha_iy_ix_i
	\label{beta}
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{equation}
	0 = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\alpha_iy_i
	\label{0}
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and substituing these in \eqref{primal} and \eqref{dual:function1}, we obtain the dual function&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{equation}
	g(\alpha) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\alpha_1-\cfrac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{k=1}^{n}\alpha_i\alpha_ky_iy_kx_i^Tx_k
	\label{dual:function2}
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dual problem is 
 \begin{align} 
&amp;amp;\underset{\alpha}{\text{max}}&amp;amp; &amp;amp; g(\alpha) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\alpha_1-\cfrac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{k=1}^{n}\alpha_i\alpha_ky_iy_kx_i^Tx_k\newline
\label{alpha}
&amp;amp; \text{subject to}
&amp;amp; &amp;amp; \alpha_i \geq 0, \; i = 1, \ldots, n.\newline
&amp;amp; &amp;amp; &amp;amp; \sum_{i=1}^{n}\alpha_iy_i = 0
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution is obtained by solving this optimal problem through a standard software. In addition, the solution  satisfy the Karush-Kuhn-Tucher conditions, which include \eqref{primal:contraint},\eqref{beta}, \eqref{0}, \eqref{alpha} and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{equation}
	\alpha_i[y_i(\beta^Tx_i+\beta_0)-1]=0, \forall i.
	\label{16}
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From these we can see that,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If $\alpha&amp;gt;0$, then $y_i(\beta^Tx_i+\beta_0)=1$, in other words, $x_i$ is support vector;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If $\alpha=0$, then $y_i(\beta^Tx_i+\beta_0)&amp;gt;1$, and $x_i$ is not support vector.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solving the optimal problem obtains the values of $\alpha$. $\beta$ and $\beta_0$ can be obtained by \eqref{beta} and \eqref{16} for any suppor vectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The optimal separating hyperplane produces a function 
$
\hat{f}(x)=\hat{\beta}^Tx+\hat{\beta}_0
$
for classifying new test observations: 
\begin{equation}
	\hat{G} = sign\; \hat{f}(x)
	\label{17}
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although none of the training observations fall in the margin, this will not necessarily the case for test observations. The intuition is that a large margin on the training data will lead to good separation on the test data. The higher the magnitude of $\hat{f}(x)$, the more confidence we are to classify the test observations.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Suport vector machine #1 - Hyperplane and margin</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this blog, I am gonan define &lt;em&gt;hyperplanes&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;margin&lt;/em&gt;. The concept of Maximal margin classifier, &lt;em&gt;support vector classifier&lt;/em&gt; and  &lt;em&gt;support vector machine&lt;/em&gt; that will be covered in future blogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hyperplane&quot;&gt;Hyperplane&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-dimensional space, a &lt;strong&gt;hyperplane&lt;/strong&gt; is a flat affine subspace of dimension &lt;em&gt;p-1&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word &lt;strong&gt;affine&lt;/strong&gt; indicates that the subspace need not pass through the origin. Mathmatic defination for &lt;em&gt;linear&lt;/em&gt; is $\beta^Tx=0$, where $\beta$ and $x$ are both vectors. Mathmatic defination for &lt;em&gt;affine&lt;/em&gt; is $\beta^Tx+\beta_0=0$, where $\beta_0$ is a real number. Because of $\beta_0$, &lt;em&gt;affine&lt;/em&gt; does not pass through the origin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of hyperplane in two dimensional space, a hyperplane is just a line. The mathmatical definition of a two-dimensional hyperplan is the equation below&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{equation}
  \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1+\beta_2X_2 = 0
  \label{1}
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for parameters $\beta_0, \beta_1$, and $\beta_2$. We can see the equation above is an equation of a line and the data point $X = (X_1, X_2)^T$ is on that line. The equation can be easily extended to the p-dimensional hyperplane:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{equation}
  \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1+\beta_2X_2+…+\beta_pX_p = 0
  \label{2}
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-dimensional data point $X = (X_1, X_2, …, X_P)^T$ would lie on that hyperplane if it satisfies the equation. So, a hyperplane naturally divides a &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-dimensional space into two halves. If a data point is not on the hyperplane, it would lie on sides of that hyperplane, then it either satisifies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{equation}
	\beta_0 + \beta_1X_1+\beta_2X_2+…+\beta_pX_p &amp;gt; 0 
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{equation}
	\beta_0 + \beta_1X_1+\beta_2X_2+…+\beta_pX_p &amp;lt; 0 
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can easily determine on which side of hyperplane a data point lies by calculating the sign of the left hand side of \eqref{hyperplane}. We define it as a function of x, and and use $\beta=(\beta_1,\beta_2,…\beta_p)^T$,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{equation}
  f(x)=\beta^Tx + \beta_0
  \label{f(x)}
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;derivation-of-marigin&quot;&gt;Derivation of Marigin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose a training dataset is &lt;strong&gt;linearly separable&lt;/strong&gt;, and it is possbile to construct at lease a hyperplane that sperates all training observations perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blogs/img/maximal-margin/maximal-margin-classifier.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figure above shows there are three possible hyperplanes, two dash line and one solid line, that are able to sperate all training data perfectly. However, if we only can pick one, which one should be selected?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we select the left dash line as separating hyperplane, and we are given a test observation which actually is from red class, and is very close to that red dot on the dash line but shifted a tiny bit up, this test observation would be misclassified. This could also happened if select the right dash line. So, the solid line is better. Furthermore, the solid line has the farthest (perpendicular) distance from nearest training observation, which distance is known as &lt;strong&gt;margin&lt;/strong&gt;. We define the distance from the nearest training observations to the hyperplane as $M$, which is half of marigin. Those training observations are &lt;strong&gt;suppor vectors&lt;/strong&gt;. In the figure above, there are three supor vectors, two green dots and one red dots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blogs/img/maximal-margin/margin.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s derivative of $M$. Suppose the class labels of green dots are $y_i = 1$, while red dots are $y_i = -1$, and $x_1 \in y_{+1}, x_2 \in y_{-1} $ are the nearest obersvations to the hyperplane. $\beta$ is the &lt;em&gt;normal vector&lt;/em&gt; (not necessarily unit vector) to the hyperplane. Then the distance, $M$, from $x_1$ to hyperplane is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{align} 
M&amp;amp; =\cfrac{\beta^T}{||\beta||}(x_1-x_0)\\ 
\label{7}
&amp;amp; =\cfrac{1}{||\beta||}(\beta^Tx_1-\beta^Tx_0)\\ 
\label{8}
&amp;amp; =\cfrac{1}{||\beta||}(\beta^Tx_1+\beta_0) 
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From \eqref{7} to \eqref{8}, because $x_0$ lies on the hyperplane, it satisifies the equations \eqref{1} and \eqref{2}. We substitudes $\beta^Tx_0$ with $-\beta_0$. On the other hand, the distance from $x_2$ to the hypeplane is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{align} 
M&amp;amp; =\cfrac{\beta^T}{||\beta||}(x_0-x_2)\\ 
&amp;amp; =\cfrac{1}{||\beta||}(\beta^Tx_0-\beta^Tx_2)\\ 
&amp;amp; =\cfrac{1}{||\beta||}(-\beta_0-\beta^Tx_2)\\ 
&amp;amp; =-\cfrac{1}{||\beta||}(\beta^Tx_2+\beta_0) 
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on our assumption, $x_1 \in y_{+1}, x_2 \in y_{-1}$, $M$ can be reformulated for any support vector $x$ as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{equation}
	M =\cfrac{y(\beta^Tx+\beta_0)}{||\beta||}
	\label{hypeplane}
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the margin is just $2M$. However, in computer science community, people always use $w$ and $b$ to representative $\beta$ and $\beta_0$, so the defination of hyperplane is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{equation}
	w^Tx+b = 0
	\label{cs:hp} 
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the defination of margin is changed to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{equation}
	M=\cfrac{y(w^Tx+b)}{||w||}
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why in the figure
$
M=\cfrac{1}{||\beta||}
$
is that people assumes the equations of those two dashed lines have the property $ y(w^Tx+b)=1 $, which will be explaned in detail in further blogs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman&#39;s earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there&#39;s no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That&#39;s how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;The Final Frontier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Reaching for the Stars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.&lt;/p&gt;
